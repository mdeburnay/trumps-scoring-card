# Bets

## Rules

- Minimum of 3 players
- Maximum number of players determined by how many hands you want to play due to the deck size. Ie. if you have 10 people, you will only be able to play up to 5.

## Logic to think about

- Determine the maximum hand size when given the total amount of players to ensure we have enoguh cards in the deck to play.
- The hand size rule - the total amount of bets places cannot equal the amount of cards in hand that turn.
- Cannot bet 0 more than twice in a row.
- First person to start the game is the youngest and/or the first letter of their name comes first in the alphabet.
- When a round is finished, dealer passes to the left.
- Within a game in a round, each game is started by the winner.
